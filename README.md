### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My only issue was getting the images in the collection view to the grid size of my liking. I was able to review the discussion tab and came across the same issue. The solution was pretty simple. Very helpful to have a discussion section to check and see if similar issues were posted and resolved. Helps save time and headaches!

Issue I came across was getting to us the updated version of AlamofireImage. Once fixed, I used the updated method to set the image.
